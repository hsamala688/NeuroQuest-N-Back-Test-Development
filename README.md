# NeuroQuest -- N-Back Cognitive Test
A web-based N-Back cognitive assessment tool built as part of the Age Well Bruins project at UCLA, aimed at supporting early detection and diagnosis of degenerative mental diseases.

## Overview
The N-Back test is a widely used cognitive exercise that measures working memory and fluid intelligence. In this test, users are presented with a sequence of stimuli and must identify when the current stimulus matches the one from N steps earlier. NeuroQuest digitizes this assessment to make it accessible, consistent, and easily deployable as part of a broader cognitive health research initiative.

## Features
- Interactive N-Back cognitive test interface
- Tracks user responses and reaction times
- Clean, accessible UI built with Tailwind CSS
- Designed to integrate with the larger Age Well Bruins health platform
